# object-detection-
This project demonstrates a real time object detection using pre-trained Caffe model involving deep learning techniques . It is a very concise code which can be learnt and accessed by even beginners.

WHAT TO DO !!
clone the repostitory
to access the project make sure you download the two caffe files (protocol,model) in your system 
run the script 

This script can detect up to 25 real time objects feed in the pre-trained caffe model
